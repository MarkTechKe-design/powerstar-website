# Powerstar Supermarkets Website - Handover Guide

Welcome to the Powerstar Supermarkets website codebase. This guide is designed for non-technical staff and administrators to help you manage content and understand the deployment structure.

## 1. The "Sandwich Rule" (Safe Text Editing)
When editing content in HTML files (like `about.html` or `index.html`), always follow the **Sandwich Rule** to avoid breaking the layout.

**The Rule:** Only edit the text *between* the opening and closing tags. Never touch the tags themselves (the parts inside `<` and `>`).

**Example:**
*   **Good:** `<h3>Welcome to Powerstar</h3>` changed to `<h3>Welcome to Our New Store</h3>`
*   **Bad:** `<h3>Welcome to Powerstar` (Missing closing tag)
*   **Bad:** `Welcome to Powerstar</h3>` (Missing opening tag)

**Think of it like a sandwich:**
*   The **Bread** is the code: `<h3>` and `</h3>`
*   The **Filling** is your content: `Welcome to Powerstar`
*   **You can change the filling, but don't eat the bread!**

## 2. Image Swapping (Banners & Promos)
You can update banners and promotional images without touching a single line of code!

**How to do it:**
1.  **Prepare your new image.** Ensure it is the same format (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) and roughly the same dimensions as the original.
2.  **Name it EXACTLY the same** as the file you want to replace.
    *   *Example:* If replacing the main slide, name your new file `supermarket-bg.jpg`.
3.  **Upload to the File Manager.** Go to the `assets/` folder (or wherever the image lives) and upload your new file.
4.  **Overwrite.** When asked, confirm that you want to **Overwrite** the existing file.
5.  **Clear Cache.** Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to see the changes instantly.

**Important Note on File Names:**
Linux servers are **Case Sensitive**.
*   `logo.png` is DIFFERENT from `Logo.png`.
*   Always use **lowercase** for filenames to be safe.
*   Never use spaces in filenames; use hyphens (`my-new-offer.jpg`).

## 3. Server Details for Deployment
*   **Server Type:** cPanel (Linux/Apache)
*   **Root Directory:** `public_html`
    *   All files in this folder must be uploaded INSIDE `public_html` on the server. Do not put them in a subfolder unless you want your site to be `yourdomain.com/subfolder`.
*   **Configuration:** The `.htaccess` file handles security and caching. Ensure it is uploaded (it might be hidden in some file managers; look for "Show Hidden Files").
